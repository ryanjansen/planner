# Ryan's personal planner for fun and profit

I realised that I cannot use any existing time management app out there. So I decided to make my own. 

## Planned features

Drag and drop your todos onto your daily schedule
Full integration with google calender
Mobile friendly interface
Sync across devices (Maybe accounts?)

Based on Cal Newports time management system in "How to be a straight-A student"
